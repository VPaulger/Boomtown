Objective
- Design the front-end of Boomtown website to communicate and update existing database for part 1 of the project.

Obstacles
- Material-UI was not user friendly. With great difficulty was able to implement most desired ui elements but not all. Found it to be a slight battle the entire way when implementing elements. After great effort and exhaustion, eventually gave up on styling the last few desired changes.
- Making queries proved to be rather simple but mutations represented a jump in complication. Manipulating data and collecting particular values required lots of careful debugging taking all clues into account.
- Would have linked to provide additional functionality for added user experience but was unable to. One particular feature included the current borrower username being displayed on the library of items in addition to the color change already implemented. Another desired feature also had to do with a borrower being that if a user's item is being borrowed then to visually display this in the "My Items" page in the same way as the library using color and a username. The last feature that I could not accomplish was a small pop up window to create an item rather than a static form on the "My Items" page. I think this would create a better user experience as this ads a level of separation between the "My Items" page and the content inside.
- Designing the schema and the resolvers was challenging overall but eventually succeeded either way.

Outcome
- Successfully create a front-end react app used to create items, list them in a library and borrow selected items. The site has been designed responsively and works in a fluid, nearly seamless way providing a pleasant user experience.
